# MLOps Deployment Project 🚀

This project implements a modular approach for machine learning operations (MLOps) using various tools and services. Below are the key components and tools used in this project:

## Modular Approach 🔧

The project follows a modular approach, organized into components and pipelines. It includes:

- **Config YAML File:** Contains configuration parameters for the project.
- **Components:** Individual modules or functions that perform specific tasks.
- **Pipelines:** Sequences of components orchestrated to execute machine learning workflows.

## Tools Used 🛠️

- **MLflow:** Used for model registry and management.
- **DVC (Data Version Control):** Utilized for pipeline orchestration and versioning data.
- **Dagshub:** Hosted repository for collaborative development and version control.
- **AWS Free Tier:** Utilized for cloud computing with a 1GB RAM instance.
- **Google Drive:** Used for storing project artifacts.
- **AWS EC2:** Hosting platform for deploying services and applications.
- **AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry):** Used for storing and managing Docker container images.
- **Docker:** Containerization technology for packaging applications and dependencies.
- **Streamlit:** Web application framework used for interactive data visualization.

## CI/CD with GitHub Actions 🚀

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are implemented using GitHub Actions. The pipelines automate the build, test, and deployment processes, delivering the project to AWS services.
